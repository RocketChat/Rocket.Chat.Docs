# Developing

First of all, thank you! It's really awesome that you're interested in
contributing to Rocket.Chat. If this is the first Open Source project
you will contribute to, we strongly suggest reading GitHub's excellent
guide ["Contributing to Open
Source"](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

## Getting Started

You can find Rocket.Chat code repositories
[here](https://github.com/RocketChat). Every repository has an Issue tab
in GitHub. Take a look at the open issues, comment on anything that
you intend to work on, and we'll add an [In Progress
label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress).
We maintain a list of [simple
tasks](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)
for devs getting started.
See [here](/6.%20Developer%20Guides/) for links to more detailed
developer guides, including workflow and API docs..

## Priority Features and / or bug fixes

* [Contact us directly](https://rocket.chat/contact) to sponsor development.

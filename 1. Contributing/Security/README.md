# Security

First of all, thank you in advance for taking the time and effort to
help us improve the security of Rocket.Chat! We are committed to
delivering an awesome and secure chat solution for, and aided by, our
community.

Given the nature of chat, we understand that our users have clear
expectations about their data being secure and private. It's clear how
important this is, and we work to the best of our abilities to ensure
your expectations are met.

## If you find a security issue

> Please email the details to Rocket.Chat's security team at [security@rocket.chat](mailto://security@rocket.chat)

Our security team will respond to confirm receipt of your message,
review and plan the mitigation of the issue, as well as set a timeline
for a new release or patch.

We follow responsible disclosure and will credit researchers when a
security issue has been identified and mitigated while adhering to the
following specifics:

- You may not use automated tools in your research without our explicit
  consent. Use of automated tools may result in investigative action or
  your IP(s) being blocked.
- Yaou may not search for vulnerabilties on our demo server. If you do
  not have your own Rocket.Chat instance and do not wish to, or cannot
  set one up, please contact us to arrange access to a staging server.
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction
  of data and interruption or degradation of our service during your
  research.
- You give us reasonable time to respond to your report and carry out
  remediation.
- We credit the first researcher to report an issue. Wwe
  reserve the right to acknowledge only those who discover issues
  in Rocket.Chat projects or related services, if we determine the
  issue(s) to be of a high or critical severity, or if the reporter
  has made continued research or contributions.
- If you wish, we will add your name and a "no-follow" link to the
  address of your choosing (e.g. Twitter or personal website), to our
  Hall of Fame..
- We will not bring any lawsuit or begin law enforcement investigation
  into you if you follow these parameters.

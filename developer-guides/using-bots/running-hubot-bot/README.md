# Running a hubot bot

The rocketchat-hubot bot can be run using either npm, docker or yoeman generator.

In all cases these instructions will ask you first to configure the environment. [Click here for info](../configure-bot-environment)

Once the bot is running and is properly logged in and connected to your RC server/configured channels, you can test by logging in as a regular user (not the BOT user), go to a configured channel and start talking to your bot (you'll find some pre-configured dialogs below)

## NPM and the boilerplate

Please see our boilerplate bot [Getting Started docs here](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate)!

The boilerplate is essentially just a simple node package that requires Hubot, the Rocket.Chat adapter and Coffeescript for its execution...

```
"dependencies": {
    "coffeescript": "^2.2.2",
    "hubot": "3",
    "hubot-rocketchat": "^2.0.0"
}
```

The bot can then be executed using a bin file in production, [as seen here](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate/tree/master/bin).
Or via the package scripts locally using `npm run local` or `yarn local`

Using the boilerplate example, to start the bot in production, use `bin/hubot -a rocketchat` - will install dependencies and run the bot with rocketchat's hubot-adaper.

[More info in Hubot's own docs here](https://hubot.github.com/docs/)

### Quick Start

Create and run a Rocket.Chat bot in under two minutes.

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate
cd hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate
npm install
```

Create a _.env_ file with content:

```
export ROCKETCHAT_URL=myserver.com
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=mybotuser
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=mypassword
export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=general
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=true
```

Adjust the content to fit your server and user credentials. Make sure `myuser` has **BOT role** on the server, if you don't know what that means, [click here](../creating-bot-users).

Then run the bot:

```
source .env
bin/hubot
```

On the server, login as a regular user (not the BOT user), go to GENERAL, and try:

```
mybotuser what is the time
```

OR

```
mybotuser rc version
```

You can examine the source code of these two bots under the `/scripts` directory, where you can add your own bot scripts written in Javascript.

## v2.x.x Development using Docker

First clone the source and then move into the directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git
cd hubot-rocketchat
```

Now we start the docker container.

```
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=<your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
    -e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot \
    -e HUBOT_NAME=bot \
    -e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostic \
    -v $PWD:/home/hubot/node_modules/hubot-rocketchat rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

On the server, login as a regular user (not the BOT user), go to GENERAL, and try:

```
mybotuser what is the time
```

### Standard

In a Hubot instance once `hubot-rocketchat` is added by npm or yarn, you can
replace the package with a development version directly:

- `cd node_modules` from the bot's project root
- `rm -rf hubot-rocketchat` to delete the published version
- `git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git` to add dev version
- `cd hubot-rocketchat` move to dev path
- `npm install` install dependencies

### Linked

Setting up a locally linked package is easier for continued development and/or
using the same development version of the adapter in multiple bots.

- Change directory to your development adapter path
- `npm link` or `yarn link` to set the origin of the link
- Change directory to your bot's project root
- `npm link hubot-rocketchat` or `yarn link hubot-rocketchat` to create the link

### Important notes

- The first time you run the docker container, the image needs to be pulled from the public docker registry and it will take some time.  Subsequent runs are super fast.
- If you are not running Linux (i.e. if you are on a Mac or PC), you cannot use $PWD to mount the volumes. Instead, [read this note here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) (the 2nd note on the page: *If you are using Boot2Docker...*) to determine the absolute path where you must place the git-cloned directory.

## Yoeman generater

You can specify the adapter during setup.

First you need to install hubot

```
npm install -g yo generator-hubot
```

Then you need to start the setup of the bot

```
mkdir myhubot
cd myhubot
yo hubot --adapter="rocketchat@1"
```

It'll ask you a few questions.

Alternatively you can actually answer the questions in one command:

```
yo hubot --owner="OWNER <owner@example.com>" --name="bot" --description="Bot" --adapter="rocketchat@0.1"
```

Also be sure to remember the name you specify.  This is what the bot will respond to in Rocket.Chat.

You will need to tell the adapter where your install is and what login information to use.

```
export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=''
export LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=bot
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=bot
export ROCKETCHAT_AUTH=password
```

Then start with: `bin/hubot -a rocketchat`

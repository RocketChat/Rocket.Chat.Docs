### App: Bad-Words Filter

* **Mentors:** [@marcelo.schmidt](https://open.rocket.chat/marceloschmidt) and [@douglas.gubert](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/douglas.gubert)
* **Description:** Rocket.Chat currently uses a third-party package to filter bad words. This poses a few problems, such as having to update the package every so often, having to check which words have been added or excluded in newer versions and deciding if we would like to keep blocking or allowing words. This project is for building an App that can be enabled in our Marketplace that will filter out a list of default bad words but will allow admins to add or delete words from that list. The app will need to cover the following requirements:
  * Create a UI for managing the App settings
  * Load a list of words from a URL
  * Add/Remove words from a list
  * Add/Remove channels where the bad words filtering is enabled \(with a toggle for "all channels"\)
  * Provide statistics on blocked words and offending users
  * Automatically deactivate users that go above a certain threshold
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript. Knowledge in how to build Rocket.Chat Apps is a plus.

### **Houston Improvements - Rocket.Chat release/changelog generator**

* **Mentors:** [@rodrigo.nascimento](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/rodrigo.nascimento)

* **Desirable Skills:** TypeScript, Git, Shell
* **Description:** Houston is the CLI tooling we use to release new versions of Rocket.Chat and generate our changelogs from merged pull requests. We want to:
  * Rewrite the tooling in TypeScript
  * Accept a new format of PR titles \(conventional changelog\)
  * Add a validation system for PRs titles via GitHub Actions
  * Add tooling to preview the generated changelog for the PR
  * Add new top level of separation for product type \(like Enterprise and Community\) based on labels
  * Support dependent repositories to import their changelogs, for example, import the changelogs of apps engine

### Add a bundler to the Apps-Compiler

* **Mentors**: [@douglas.gubert ](https://open.rocket.chat/douglas.gubert)
* **Description**: Currently the Apps-Compiler package uses the bare TypeScript compiler to process apps' code and generate the JS version. This has some limitations, e.g. we can't "simply" bundle the whole app in a single file, we can't bundle npm packages, and so on. By changing this compiler into a proper bundler \(Webpack, Rollup, etc.\), we would have access to a richer ecosystem of tooling to handle the compilation process of Rocket.Chat Apps.
* **Desirable Skills**: JS/TS, familiarity with bundlers \(using them, not necessarily writing one\) would be interesting

### **Stop notifications and Notifications schedule**

    * With the option to configure for every day from X time to Y time
    * With the option to configure for weekdays from X time to Y time
    * With the option to configure X and Y times for each day of the week manually
    * The same settings should be available for the workspace admin to configure a default value for all users
    * The implementation should cover the web and mobile applications

### **Support share location on mobile apps**

* **Mentors:** [@diego.mello](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/diego.mello)

## Project Ideas

### Voice Channels

* **Mentors**: [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Description**: The ability to create voice channels would allow users to quickly enter and leave pre-existing voice calls from Rocket.Chat's own UI, enabling a more practical usage of audio features for team collaboration. This project would add the UI elements and integrate them with an established audio plataform to handle the calls.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS fullstack webapp development.

### Task Channels

* **Mentors**: [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Description**: This project aims to create a new kind of channel where instead of sending messages, users would be able to create task cards with several custom fields. Those tasks would then work as a thread header, allowing comments in the format of a thread. The basic additional information for a task message would be an assigned user and a status. The channel header should also list options to filter the tasks by those fields.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS fullstack webapp development. Experience with ReacJS is ideal.

### Ephemeral messages

* **Mentors:** [**@kevin.aleman**](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/EeTm6vJYv9KSiNwq9)\*\*\*\*
* **Description:** This project aims to create a kind of channel in which the messages sent will vanish after a configured amount of time. This would be a room \(channel\) setting, in which you can define how long the messages are going to last. Messages from here cannot be retrieved after its deletion and the deletion cannot be deactivated, just postponed.
* **Desirable skills:** Familiarity with JS Full Stack webapp development. Experience with MongoDB and PM2 are ideal.

### Apps-Engine E2E Testing

* **Mentors:** [@lolimay](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/shiqi.mei)
* **Description:** This project aims to improve Apps-Engine end-to-end testing by adding more testing cases. The Apps-Engine APIs should be covered as many as possible to ensure that APIs tested are working. This project requires you to work across multiple repos ([Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) and [Apps-Engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine)). Checkout these links for the context:

*   - [Apps-Engine E2E Testing Folder on Rocket.Chat side](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/tests/end-to-end/apps)
* **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript. Experience with TypeScript and end-to-end testing are better.

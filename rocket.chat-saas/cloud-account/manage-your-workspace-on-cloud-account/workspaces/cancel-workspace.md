{% hint style="info" %}
Only cloud customers can cancel their workspaces. Self-managed customers can not do that.
{% endhint %}

If you want to stop using the SaaS service, you can go ahead and cancel it, as shown below:

Reload and the Status shows it's '**canceling'**. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The status should remain '**canceling'** until the end of your billing cycle. 
{% endhint %}

After the billing cycle is ended the status should change to '**canceled'**, as shown below:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you change your mind within 15 days of your workspace getting canceled, please reach out to us at [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get your workspace revived. After 15 days you will have to create a new one.

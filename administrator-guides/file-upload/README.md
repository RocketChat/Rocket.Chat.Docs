# File Upload

There are several choices for file storage:

- GridFS
- [Amazon S3](amazon-s3/)
- [Google Cloud Storage](google-cloud-storage/)
- [WebDAV](webdav/)
- [Minio](minio/) - selfhosted S3 compatible object storage
- Local file system

To change the system from the default GridFS, select the option you prefer from the `Storage Type` section.

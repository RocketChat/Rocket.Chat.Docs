# PagerDuty

[PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com) is an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams. It collects alerts from your monitoring tools, gives you an overall view of all of your monitoring alarms, and alerts an on duty engineer in case of any problem.

Read the [installation guide](<https://github.com/kajisaap/rocketchat-pagerduty>) for detailed instructions.

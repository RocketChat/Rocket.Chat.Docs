# Monitors

LiveChat monitors supervise specified departments without receiving permissions to manage the Omnichannel itself, which makes this role different if compared to  the LiveChat manager.

With the appropriate permissions, LiveChat managers or admins assign the monitor role from one of the following areas of LiveChat:

* **LiveChat Settings**:

* **Administration > Users > Edit**:

## Units

Monitors can supervise units, which are selected departments or a single department.

This is best practice in scenarios which include several departments running. In this scenario, you can assign the department head to monitor the LiveChat activity for their department.

The monitor sees the chat list, agents, analytics, added or removed agents, but does see other LiveChat settings or manage other chats. See the details about monitor settings below.

* **Visibility** settings allow you to set the unit in public or private mode. Note that with a public setting, monitors from other units can see a public unit's chat rooms in their chat room list. If a unit is set to private, monitors of other units do not see that unit's chat rooms.

    For example, if we create two units named after their departments: _Support_ and _Customer Success_, the examples below show what chat room lists look like when units are set to public or private mode.

    * The chat room lists when our units (_Customer Success_ and _Support_) are both public, as it appears to a monitor assigned to only one of the units:

    * The chat room lists when one of the units (_Customer Success_) is set to private, and the monitor assigned only to the _Support_ unit looks at it:

* **Monitors** allows you to add any valid user to be a monitor with access to LiveChat rooms, department settings, working hours. Monitors can manage LiveChat and agents. Unless the users have admin rights or specific permissions granted, they cannot manage LiveChat appearance, routing rules and other omnichannel configurations.

* **Selected Monitors** shows the monitors assigned to a specified unit.

* **Selected Departments** shows the departments added to a specified unit and assigned to the specified supervisors. To add more departments, select them from the list of **Available Departments**.

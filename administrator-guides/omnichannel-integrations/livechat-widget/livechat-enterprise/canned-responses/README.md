# Canned Responses

With canned responses, Enterprise users can send response templates tp LiveChat and other rooms.

A canned response includes two attributes:

* `shortcut` - a name beginning with an exclamation mark (`!`), used to call the template.
* `text` - the content users enter into the Text field.

## Enable Canned Responses

To enable canned responses go to **Administration > Canned Responses**

By default, the livechat-agent, livechat-monitor, and admin roles receive permissions to save, delete and view canned responses:

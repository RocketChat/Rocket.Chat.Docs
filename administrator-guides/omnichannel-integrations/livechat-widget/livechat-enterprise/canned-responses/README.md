# Canned Responses

Canned responses are used to send response templates in Livechat and other rooms.

A canned response has two attributes:
* `shortcut`, which is a name that starts with an exclamation mark (!) used to call the template.
* `text`, which is the content entered into the Text field.

First enable canned responses under **Administration > Canned Responses**

By default, permissions to save, delete and view canned responses are given to livechat-agent, livechat-monitor, livechat-agent and admin roles:

To create a new canned response, go to an open livechat room, click on a canned response icon in the top-right navigation bar. Click **New Canned Response**. Fill in the `shortcut` and the `text` fields, click save.

To apply a canned response, simply start your message with an exclamation mark (!):

Select the response you need and click **Send**. You can start typing the shortcut name to find the necessary response if you have many of them.

Your canned responses are ready for messaging with users on your server.

### Android and iOS Mobile users

Enter the URL to your Rocket.Chat server (e.g. <https://open.rocket.chat>) to initialize the app. This needs to be done the first time you run the app after installation.

Use two-fingers swipe up gesture to add more servers if you need to access multiple servers from one client.

### Android and iOS Mobile Users running Rocket.Chat server on a Sandstorm Grain

1. On your phone in a browser open Sandstorm and open the Rocket.Chat grain.
2. Open the hamburger menu (upper-left) and choose "Get Webkey". (On the desktop view, you would click the key icon in the topbar.)
3. Optionally enter a label (e.g. "phone") and then click "create".
4. You'll be presented with a URL, aka a "webkey". Long-press on this URL, then choose "copy link address".
5. Open the rocket.chat app.
6. Paste in the copied URL (the whole thing!) as your Rocket.Chat server address.
7. That's it! No password is needed, since an authorization token is encoded into the URL.

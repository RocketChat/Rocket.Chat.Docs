## Project Ideas

### iOS Voice Over Accessibility

- **Mentors:** @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS>
- **Description:** VoiceOver is a gesture-based screen reader that lets you enjoy using iPhone even if you donâ€™t see the screen. This is especially important for those with low or no vision. We want to make Rocket.Chat for everyone. A blind user should be able to easily add servers, change servers, read messages and send messages, as well as other additional functions such as editing profile and creating channels. Minimum acceptable scope is to be determined.
- **Desirable Skills:** We are looking for an undergraduate student who is familiar with team work, developing iOS Apps using UIKit and Swift, as well as writing maintainable code with Unit Tests and having some familiarity with Voice Over and Accessibility.

### Apple Watch & Siri Support

- **Mentors**: @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS>
- **Description**: Create an Apple Watch application that replicates the most basic features we have in our iOS mobile client, such like viewing the chat rooms and reading the messages. Let user ask Siri to read latest messages, send messages or respond to a message.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with WatchKit development on WatchOS & SiriKit. Ability to work in large multi-disciplinary teams.

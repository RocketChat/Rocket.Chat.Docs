## Project Ideas

### XXXXX Search

- **Mentors:** @XXXXX
- **Description:** Add XXXX XXXXX to Rocket.Chat, allowing users to search across messages, rooms, files, users, etc in a single and easy to use interface. Like a macOS Spotlight search.
- **Desirable Skills:** XXXXXXX

### Users XXXX integration plus XXXXX

- **Mentors:** @XXXX.XXX
- **Description:** Rocket.Chat XXXX allows for users to add custom fields through a setting that accepts a XXXXX. We would like to create an interface to manage these custom fields. Each custom field must be composed of label, type (one of predefined: string, number, picklist, money, etc.), and an option to determine if this field must be displayed on registration or not. On Users Directory, users must be able to select multiple records from the results and do one of the possible actions: add to existing channel or group and create new channel or group; if only one record is selected, it should also be possible to start a direct message with the selected user.
- **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript development.

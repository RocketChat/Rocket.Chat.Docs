- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with WatchKit development on WatchOS & SiriKit. Ability to work in large multi-disciplinary teams.

### Implement Dark theme for Android app

- **Mentors**: @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android>
- **Description**: Themes are very popular and they’re part of what makes Android stand out from the rest. But the current Rocket Chat Android app lacks the feature of applying different themes.This project aims to bring different themes like dark mode and black mode into the existing Android Client.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with Android development, specifically the Rocket.Chat.Android code base.

### Google Calendar Rocket.Chat App

- **Mentors**: @d-gubert, @rodrigok
- **Description**: The [Rocket.Chat Apps Engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine) is here to make it easier to extend Rocket.Chat's functionality without having to deep dive into the code base. The goal of this project is to leverage the Apps Engine capabilities to create an integration with Google Calendar, using Slashcommands, custom API endpoints, custom Settings, etc.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with TypeScript.

### Service Accounts in Rocket.Chat

- **Mentors:** @karan.bedi, @bizzbyster
- **Description:** Adding the functionality of Service accounts to Rocket.Chat. A service account is an account owned by a User (owner), having basic profile (username, avatar, description etc.). If any other User (initiating user) creates a direct messages(DM) session with this service account, this chat session is carried to the owner of the service account. The owner can then reply to this chat session, but to the initiating user it would seem that the reply is coming from the service account. An authorised user should be able to create service accounts, transfer the ownership of the service account. Service accounts should be searchable, there should be a directory of service accounts. Also, users should be able to subscribe to service accounts, and a service account owner should be able to send broadcast messages to its subscribers. Automated tests should be written to cover the added functionality.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with JavaScript development & Rocket.Chat code base

### Newsfeed

- **Mentors:** @bizzbyster, @karan.bedi
- **Description:** Adding the functionality of newsfeed, which is similar to a customised read-only channel for every user. Every user (follower) can follow other users (followed user). Posts from the followed user appears in the newsfeed of their followers. Posts are threaded discussions, started by the followed user in any public channel (origin channel), their follower can or cannot be a part of the origin channel but this post comes up in thier wall with a permalink to the orignal post in the origin channel. This helps in discovering new conversations. Interns are encouraged to propose entensions to this like wall, where a user can post threads that show up in thier follower's feed, status updates, etc. Automated tests should be written to cover the added functionality.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with JavaScript development & Rocket.Chat code base

### Improved Test Automation in Rocket.Chat Repos

- **Mentors** @TBD
- **Description:** The goal of this project is to enhance the current test infrastructure in the RocketChat repos and pipelines.  Currently there is some very minimal junit testing that needs to be expanded, and no integration or system level tests, or infrastructure to support them.  This project could focus on one of the repos, possibly the Android code base, or all.  Once a test infrastructure and best practice is established, the goal is that no new code gets merged unless it has new tests that will be run at build time, and it passes all of the previous tests.

### Custom Notifications in Android

- **Mentors:** @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android>
- **Description:** The web client currently has the flexibility of customizing the notifications per channel but the Android client lacks this feature. This project aims to bring this feature into the Android client. Users would be able to mute specific channels and configure if they want to receive notifications when they are mentioned or for every notification, etc. Snooze functionality can also be implemented as an extension of this project.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with Android development, specifically the Rocket.Chat.Android code base.

### iOS Voice Over Accessibility

A blind user should be able to easily add servers, change servers, read messages and send messages, as well as other additional functions such as editing profile and creating channels. Minimum acceptable scope is to be determined.
- **Desirable Skills:** We are looking for an undergraduate student who is familiar with team work, developing iOS Apps using UIKit and Swift, as well as writing maintainable code with Unit Tests and having some familiarity with Voice Over and Accessibility.

### Ability to Rebrand Android and iOS Apps

- **Mentors:** @TBD
- **Description:** Implement a way for administrators to rebrand their instances of rocketchat - product name, icons, colors, etc - for the android and ios apps, which currently do not support this. Besides adding this capability, another goal would be to make this branding across all the OS’s easy for an administrator that may not be too tech savvy. Ideally this would only be a few easy steps. Besides this ease-of-use improvement, this would also make it less likely that people will fork rocket in order to put in their own branding.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with Android and/or iOS development, specifically the Rocket.Chat.Android/Rocket.Chat.iOS code bases.

### Asana Rocket.Chat App

- **Mentors**: @d-gubert, @rodrigok

### Allow Rocket.Chat Apps to use their own NPM modules

- **Mentors**: @d-gubert, @rodrigok
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine>
- **Description**: Currently the Rocket.Chat Apps Engine does not support that apps include their own `node_modules` dependencies, which can be very limiting in some use cases. The goal of this project is to modify our engine so that it can properly install and manage an app's dependencies, enabling app developers to unleash their full potential.
- **Desirable Skills**: Solid understanding of JavaScript and some familiarity with TypeScript. Familiarity with TypeScript's compiler is definitely a plus.

### Improve Rocket.Chat Auto-Translate feature

- **Mentors**: @marceloschmidt
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/packages/rocketchat-autotranslate>
- **Description**: Rocket.Chat Auto-Translate features work by translating every incoming message into the user language of choice. We would like the student to make it possible for the package to also translate every message the user sends into another language. As a plus, if the student can implement a channel language setting, it would be superb.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with Rocket.Chat development and meteor packages.

### Users Directory integration plus custom fields editor and search

- **Mentors**: @marceloschmidt
- **Description**: Rocket.Chat already allows for users to add custom fields through a setting that accepts a JSON. We would like to create an interface to manage these custom fields. Each custom field must be composed of label, type (one of predefined: string, number, picklist, money, etc.), and an option to determine if this field must be displayed on registration or not. On Users Directory, users must be able to select multiple records from the results and do one of the possible actions: add to existing channel or group and create new channel or group; if only one record is selected, it should also be possible to start a direct message with the selected user.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Rocket.Chat development.

### Mattermost Data Importer

- **Mentors**: TBD
- **Description**: Rocket.Chat is currently capable of importing data exported from Slack and HipChat, but there's no importer for Mattermost data. This is a valuable feature that the application is still missing.

### iOS contacts sync, invites & dynamic links

- **Mentors**: @TBD
- **Description**: In the Rocket.Chat iOS native application, add the functionality of listing all the contacts of a user, syncing in background these contacts with the server using existing APIs and displaying the intersection with public accounts on server. Integrating the APIs to invite users that do not have an account (via email / phone) or inviting via other applications on phone. Support dynamic links in iOS app, allow the creation of links such that when invited through one, after installation of the app it opens a DM with the inviter, etc. `These functionalities are already implemented for Android in a fork.`
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with iOS development.

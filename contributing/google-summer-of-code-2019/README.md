## Project Ideas

### Service Accounts in Rocket.Chat

- **Mentors:** @karan.bedi, @bizzbyster
- **Description:** Adding the functionality of Service accounts to Rocket.Chat. A service account is an account owned by a User (owner), having basic profile (username, avatar, description etc.). If any other User (initiating user) creates a direct messages(DM) session with this service account, this chat session is carried to the owner of the service account. The owner can then reply to this chat session, but to the initiating user it would seem that the reply is coming from the service account. An authorised user should be able to create service accounts, transfer the ownership of the service account. Service accounts should be searchable, there should be a directory of service accounts. Also, users should be able to subscribe to service accounts, and a service account owner should be able to send broadcast messages to its subscribers. Automated tests should be written to cover the added functionality.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with JavaScript development & Rocket.Chat code base

### XXXXX Search

- **Mentors:** @XXXXX
- **Description:** Add XXXX XXXXX to Rocket.Chat, allowing users to search across messages, rooms, files, users, etc in a single and easy to use interface. Like a macOS Spotlight search.
- **Desirable Skills:** XXXXXXX

### Users XXXX integration plus XXXXX

- **Mentors:** @XXXX.XXX
- **Description:** Rocket.Chat XXXX allows for users to add custom fields through a setting that accepts a XXXXX. We would like to create an interface to manage these custom fields. Each custom field must be composed of label, type (one of predefined: string, number, picklist, money, etc.), and an option to determine if this field must be displayed on registration or not. On Users Directory, users must be able to select multiple records from the results and do one of the possible actions: add to existing channel or group and create new channel or group; if only one record is selected, it should also be possible to start a direct message with the selected user.
- **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript development.

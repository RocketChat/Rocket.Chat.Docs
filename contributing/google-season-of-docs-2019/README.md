## Project Ideas

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) Documentation Playground

- **Mentors**: @martin.schoeler, @marcos.defendi
- **Description**: When developing applications, developers can use a rich set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by Rocket.Chat to control every aspect of Rocket.Chat's operation. The documentation for this set of APIs mixes automated generation with hand crafted usage descriptions, application scenarios, and coding examples. The "playground" makes this documentation comes alive.  Developer can visit the API page and actually interact with the API directly through the documentation page.  You will work with two mentors specialized in API coding and documentatation generation for this project.

### Android Kotlin Software Development Kit (Kotlin SDK) documentation

- **Mentors**: @filipe.brito, @rafael.kellermann
- **Description**: Modern Android mobile developers typically use Kotlin to create their mobile apps.  To make developing Rocket.Chat integrated and compatible Android apps simpler,  Rocket.Chat has created a comprehensive Software Development Kit (SDK) for Kotlin. This project will involve the detailed documentation for the SDK features, application scenarios, and APIs.   You will be working closely with Rocket.Chat mobile leads, the developers who actually coded the SDK, during your term.

### JS SDK documentation

- **Mentors**: TBD
- **Description**: Document all the implementation of JS SDK.

### Apps Engine guides

- **Mentors**: TBD
- **Description**: Create guides of how to start developing apps for Rocket.Chat

### The Bot Docs

- **Mentors**: @reetp @sing.li
- **Description**: Working with core developers and the open source community advocates in the Rocket.Chat community this is your opportunity to join us and dive into the exciting world of Chatbots and Machine Learning (ML). Bots are tomorrows technology, today. Automating and simplifying life for both user and provider, the demand for this technology and how to develop and deploy, is huge. Rocket.Chat has integrated support for bots created via different programming languages and deployment methods to leverage the power of Rocket.Chat. This includes leading services and frameworks such as Dialogflow, Botpress, RASA, Botkit, hubot, and bbot. Documenting this in a clear and precise manner, from bot development and usage through to more advanced deployments, is a huge task and vital to Rocket.Chat and its users.

### Security documentation

- **Mentors**: @markus.kirsch
- **Description**: We at Rocket.Chat take pride in taking extra efforts in providing a true open source and secure messenging solution. Transparency and trust are key features of our products. This is an exciting opportunity to work with our team of experts to create a comprehensive documentation of the security features of Rocket.chat and create implementation guides for configuring Rocket.Chat to follow compliance regimes such as GDPR, HIPAA and NIST.

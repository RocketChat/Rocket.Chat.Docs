Each custom field must be composed of label, type (one of predefined: string, number, picklist, money, etc.), and an option to determine if this field must be displayed on registration or not. On Users Directory, users must be able to select multiple records from the results and do one of the possible actions: add to existing channel or group and create new channel or group; if only one record is selected, it should also be possible to start a direct message with the selected user.
- **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript development.

### Storage integration with Google Drive and/or Dropbox

- **Mentors:** @marcelo.schmidt, @martin.schoeler (co-mentor)

Within this short summer, you will gain experience in working on a global-circulation production-grade blockchain-powered adoption-acceleration platform.  You will also meet and work with leading visionaries and pioneers in the current blockchain / crypto field.   Tangible potential to become an early architect of this brave new world, supported by Rocket.Chat.

Some projects that you can submit proposals for include:

#### Decentralized Crpto Exchange in Rocket.Chat

- **Description:** Starting either from scratch or utilizing one of the compatible license open source DEX code bases – create a functional Decentralized Exchange within Rocket.Chat.  You will create a DEX that takes advantage of strong cryptographic identity solutions such as Blockstack ID and wallet integration such as Metamask or ARK wallet in your work.

#### IPFS storage solution in Rocket.Chat

- **Description:**  Integreate IPFS into Rocket.Chat as a viable storage provider.   Ideally IPFS can be used as a storage provider for uploaded Rocket.Chat contents.   In addition, the ability to acesss IPFS within Rocket.Chat, to supply files that can be shared between users of Rocket.Chat is also essential.  Leveraging integration with strong cryptographic identities such as Blockstack ID, the solution should include strong  data-at-rest encryption of decentralized contents.  Use of decentralized storage abstraction frameworks such as Blockstack Gaia should be considered to simplify this work.  Use of IPFS as a decentralized storage for Rocket.Chat’s data should also be considered within the term.

#### Cryptocurrency Wallet and/or Portoflio Management in Rocket.Chat

- **Description:** Enable the integration of wallet(s) such as Metamask,  MyEtherWallet,  ARK or other wallets or crypto portfolio management system within Rocket.Chat.
- **Desirable Skills:** Looking for a unique fringe-dropout university student already committed to our inevitable decentralized future powered by Web 3.0 and continued blockchain technology innovations.  While maintaining a high score on all your subjects, you should be finding your existing university education ridiculously limiting, and already have experience hacking smart contracts, minting tokens for friends and family, hacking ethereum, and trading cryptokitties. You eat truffle for breakfast and ride the open zepplin to school every  day. Recent government (perhaps your own government) baseless  advances into this area has significantly disturbed you. You already realized that you are way ahead of your time.  And you will recognize this GSoC 2018 project to be the absolutely not-to-miss opportunity of your life.

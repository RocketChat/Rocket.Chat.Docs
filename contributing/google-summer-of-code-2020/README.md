## Project Ideas

### Omnichannel: Real-Time Visitor Monitoring

- **Mentors**: @renatobecker
- **Description**: The goal of Real-Time Visitor Monitoring is to provide an important feature for the Live chat team by displaying a list of visitors who are browsing the website where the Livechat widget is installed. Having this feature, it will be possible to track important information related to visitors, such as the current page, location, time on site, local time, and so on, even though the visitor has not yet started a conversation with an agent. In addition, an agent will be able to start a conversation with a specific visitor directly from the list, improving the proactivity of the Live chat team.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Rocket.Chat/Livechat development.

### Improve Documentation Framework

- **Mentors**: @martinscholeler
- **Description**: Revamp the documentation generation and hosting framework on Jekyll to ease the barrier of entry for contributors trying to run the enviornment on their own machines.   Making it more contributor friendly.  In addition, add support for multi-lingual AND multi-releases for documentation.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Ruby on Rails development.  Working knowledge of Jekyll and documentation generation framwork highly useful.

### Ability to Rebrand ReactNative Mobile Apps

- **Mentors:** @jaytat0, @bizzbyster
- **Description:** Implement a way for administrators to rebrand their instances of rocketchat - product name, icons, colors, etc. - for the android and ios apps, which currently do not support this. Besides adding this capability, another goal would be to make this branding across all the OSâ€™s easy for an administrator that may not be too tech savvy. Ideally, this would only be a few easy steps. Besides this ease-of-use improvement, this would also make it less likely that people will fork rocket to put in their own branding.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with ReactNative development is absolutely necessary.  Candadite should have both iOS and Android experience.

### Omnichannel: Support for Voice and Video Calls

- **Mentors**: @gazzo, @tazzo
- **Description**: We've been working on our new Omnichannel solution and it's time to add two great new features that will make Omnichannel even more powerful: voice and video calls! The idea is to integrate Omnichannel with the providers already supported in Rocket.Chat, such as Jitsi, WebRTC, BigBlueButton and so on. With these two new features, Omnichannel users will be able to initiate video and audio calls between them and Omnichannel agents.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Rocket.Chat/Omnichannel development, ReactJS/PreactJS, Voice and Video communication

### Alexa Skill(s) Improvement

- **Mentors**: @ashish.jha @prajval.raval
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/alexa-rocketchat>
- **Description**: Bring access of Rocket.Chat into the world of 100 million+ Alexa enabled devices.  The project should aim beyond the obvious TTS <-> STT "Rocket.Chat bridging" of intelligent VUI terminal devices and create innovative, high valued user experiences to the Alexa ecosystem - powered by open source Rocket.Chat.   Google Home/Assistant devices support, if possible, should also be considered concurrently.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Alexa skills development. Experience with interfacing external sources and systems into Alexa skills. Passion for global converstational interaction enablement. Familiarity with Google Action development ideal.

### Omnichannel:  Chatbot support for RASA and Dialogflow

- **Mentors**: @renatobecker
- **Description**: The goal of this project would be to chatbot framework support for popular BOT frameworks - RASA and Dialogflow.
- **Desirable Skills**: Experience in working with Dialogflow or RASA desirable.  Ideally an experienced Python developer with some Javascript skills.

### Nextcloud Video Management

- **Mentors**: @guilherme.gazzo
- **Description**: Add the ability to manage and access recorded and previously live streamed video within the Rocket.Chat integrated Nextcloud environment. Similar to Youtube but with a chat-centric access interface.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud development.  Deep understanding of current digital streaming and recorded media standards a big plus.

### Mattermost Data Importer

- **Mentors**: TBD
- **Description**: Rocket.Chat is currently capable of importing data exported from Slack and HipChat, but there's no importer for Mattermost data. This is a valuable feature that the application is still missing.

# OmniChannel Admin Guide



Rocket.Chat had minimal Livechat as a feature for a long time.

Recently the demand for production-grade Livechat has increased, so we did a complete rewrite of the package.

## Activation 

### Enable Livechat feature

To enable the Livechat feature on your Rocket.Chat instance:

1. Go to **Administration.**

2. Search '**Omnichannel'** in **Settings** and enable it.

Now the admin will have access to _**Omnichannel Panel Settings**_ **** through a new menu called `Omnichannel` at the top left corner dropdown menu, as shown below:

2. Enable/Disable request comment from the agent when closing a conversation.
3.  Enable/Disable acceptance of new omnichannel requests when the agent is idle

### Business Hour

The feature turns on the omnichannel toggle for the set business hours automatically. And you will be able to receive omnichannel conversations after. The toggle will be turned off during off-hours. The enterprise workspaces have an option to set up multiple business hours according to different time zones and their business needs. Community workspaces can only set up one set of business hours.

1. Enable business hours.
2. Choose multiple business hours according to your enterprise needs.

### CRM Integration

1. Enable external frame.
2.  Add the URL of your external frame.
3. Enter the encryption key, as shown beow:

### Facebook

If your organization wishes to communicate with users of Facebook, you can enable integration within Rocket.Chat to do so.

First, you will need to request an API key from Rocket.Chat Support then set it up within your Administration area.

Send an email to [omni@rocket.chat](mailto:omni@rocket.chat) to request an API key. These are processed as time allows, and may take a few days, but you should have your key and secret soon enough.



1. Enable Facebook integration.
2. Enter your _OmniChannel API Key_ 
3. _Enter OmniChannel API Secret_. **Save** the changes.

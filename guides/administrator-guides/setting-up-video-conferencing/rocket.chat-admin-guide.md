# Rocket.Chat Meet Admin Guide

## Rocket.Chat Meet \(Powered by WebRTC\)

Rocket.Chat Meet \(in some places named as WebRTC\) is our own take on implementing pure WebRTC. It still a work in progress but if you want to use it you can go to `Administration -> WebRTC`.

From there you can set where video conferences can be held \(channels, private rooms, and direct messages\).

You can also define a list of `STUN/TURN` Servers to be used.
